# SNHU-CS-330
Computer Graphics and Visualization


        For this project I did what I could to stick to Objected Oriented Principles with my design. I could 
    definitely improve on the overall code, but the end result provided an organized and mutable product. 
    The time constraints in the class structure and learning material made me focus more on usability of 
    my code over a truly OOP program with full encapsulation and polymorphism. I created a specific class 
    of headers to perform the necessary renderization of both the shapes and scene objects. Keeping them in 
    seperate header files allowed me to easily create each item in my main.cpp. I also took advantage of the 
    mutablity of vector lists to help build the necessary vertices for the shape, textures, colors, and normals 
    of my objects. Going forward, this gave me invaluable experience to understand where I can improve, what 
    really works well for my code, and how it all fits together. Using the lessons I had for this project 
    will help become a better developer. 
        
        When I first approached this project I wanted to make my main focus on providing code that I could easily 
    update. This is especially important as I worked through lessons and needed to fit the necessary functions into 
    my program. For instance, I spent a lot of time in my shapes class each week, updating the necessary vertices for 
    texture of the normals. The vectors I had developed were easily updated to accomodate this new functionality and made it 
    easy to create the items in my world. Overall, it simply took me longer to truly understand the new topics than 
    actually developing the code to implement. There is always room for improvement and growth, but I feel I have built 
    a solid foundation given my limited experience with OpenGL/GLSL. 
    
        Learning and developing this project has been one of my most favorite experiences so far in my programming journey. 
    From start to finish I learned so much that will help me in my educational and professional career. I hope to gain more 
    experience such as this one because I learned so much in such a short amount of time.
